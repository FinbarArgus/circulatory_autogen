These functions can be used as cost functions. Specify a name of one of these functions as the "cost_type" in obs_data.json to
use it as the cost.

When making your own cost function make sure it works for scalars and vectors. Otherwise put an error message so that if it is used
for the wrong data type it gets called out and stopped.
