"""The documentation has to describe the package that actually ships (issue #437).

Two things in the docs rot silently, because nothing imports them and nothing runs them:

1. **Import instructions.** Before the package existed, every documented snippet appended
   ``src/`` to the interpreter's import path and imported flat module names (``import
   parsers``). Both stopped being true when the code moved under ``libcuflynx/``: the flat
   names survive only as deprecation shims that warn now and are gone in a later release,
   and there is
   nothing to add to the import path at all. A doc that still teaches the old way sends every
   new reader down it.

2. **Lists of commands.** The entry-point table in ``CLAUDE.md`` and the one in ``README.md``
   restate ``[project.scripts]`` in prose. Adding, renaming or removing a console command
   changes ``pyproject.toml`` and leaves the tables behind.

These are cheap to check mechanically, so they are checked mechanically. No imports, no
subprocesses -- this reads files.
