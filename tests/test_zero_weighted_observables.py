"""A weight-0 observable the emulator cannot predict, and does not have to.

``EmulatorTrainer`` refuses non-scalar data_items up front, because the emulator
predicts scalar features and a ``series`` cost would otherwise fail a hundred
simulations later with a shape mismatch. That check was on ``data_type`` alone,
which made it stricter than the thing it protects: a zero-weighted item is
dropped from the cost entirely, so the emulator is never asked for it --
``emulated_feature_labels`` is built from ``const_idx_to_obs_idx`` and excludes
non-constants already.

The case that matters is carrying a recorded trace at weight 0 so it can be drawn
behind the simulated one. Without it an output-vs-time plot has nothing to
compare against but a few horizontal lines reduced from the same recording.
Before this, that forced a second obs_data file whose only purpose was to keep
the emulator from refusing.
