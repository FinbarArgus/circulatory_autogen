"""
Regression tests for state continuity across protocol sub-experiments.

A multi-sub-experiment protocol must carry the model state forward from one
sub-experiment to the next, exactly as if the whole horizon had been run as a
single segment.  The OpenCOR and Python (solve_ivp) backends do this correctly;
the Myokit backend historically did NOT, because
``MyokitSimulationHelper.update_times`` called ``simulation.reset()`` (which
reverts Myokit to its *default*/initial state) without restoring the carried
state.  Every sub-experiment after the first therefore restarted from the model
initial conditions.

This reproduces the bug with a simple, public model (Lotka-Volterra) so it can
live in circulatory_autogen CI.  It was first observed on a private glucose
metabolism model run with multi-meal protocols, where Myokit diverged from
OpenCOR by 30-100%.

Backends:
- Myokit self-consistency (always runs): a ``[T/2, T/2]`` two-sub-experiment run
  must equal a ``[T]`` single segment.
- Myokit vs Python/solve_ivp (always runs; cross-backend check that works in CI,
  since the Python backend ships with circulatory_autogen and carries state forward
  correctly).
- Myokit vs OpenCOR (skipped when OpenCOR is unavailable, e.g. in CI).
