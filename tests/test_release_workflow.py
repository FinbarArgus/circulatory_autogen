"""The release workflow has to keep matching PyPI's trusted publisher (issue #438).

Publishing is configured in two places that cannot see each other: this repository's workflow
file, and a *pending publisher* registered on PyPI against the four-tuple

    owner=physiomelinks  repo=circulatory_autogen  workflow=release.yml  environment=pypi

If the workflow is renamed, the environment is renamed or dropped, or `id-token: write` is
lost, the build still goes green and only the upload fails -- on the one run nobody can retry,
because a PyPI version can never be re-uploaded. Nothing else in the repository would notice,
so these assertions stand in for the feedback the first release will not give us.

They deliberately do not run anything: no build, no network, no upload. Whether the package
actually publishes can only be established by publishing it.
