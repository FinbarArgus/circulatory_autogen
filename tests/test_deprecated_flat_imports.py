"""The flat top-level names keep working for one release, loudly and *identically*.

``from param_id.paramID import CVS0DParamID`` was how every user script, notebook and
tutorial reached this code before the ``libcuflynx`` rename. The shims in ``src/<name>/``
buy those scripts one release. Two things have to hold, and both fail silently if we get
them wrong:

* **Identity.** ``param_id.paramID`` must be the *same module object* as
  ``libcuflynx.param_id.paramID``. If it is a second copy, a user's
  ``isinstance(x, CVS0DParamID)`` stops matching and their monkeypatch stops taking
  effect, with no error anywhere.
* **Exactly one warning per shim.** One per attribute access, or one per submodule, turns
  a migration notice into noise people filter out.
* **No collateral damage.** The shim roots are eleven generic words and the finder that
  serves them sits at ``sys.meta_path[0]``. Nobody else's ``utilities`` or ``models`` may
  start resolving to ours because something in the process imported a deprecated name.
