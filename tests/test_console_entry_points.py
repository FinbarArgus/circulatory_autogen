"""The console commands declared in ``[project.scripts]`` must actually exist and answer.

A `[project.scripts]` entry is a string. Nothing checks it at build time, nothing checks it
at install time -- setuptools writes a launcher that imports the named module and calls the
named attribute, and the first anyone hears about a typo, a renamed module or a missing
``main`` is a traceback from ``cuflynx-param-id`` (or, worse, from rank 3 of an MPI job that
had already been queued for an hour).

So the table below is read out of ``pyproject.toml`` rather than restated here: every entry
point that exists is tested, and a new one cannot be added without being covered.

Each target is exercised in a subprocess. In-process would import six stage modules into the
pytest session -- opening MPI, matplotlib and the solver backends as a side effect -- and
``--help`` calls ``sys.exit``, so the isolation is worth the process spawn.
