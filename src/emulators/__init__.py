"""Deprecated alias for :mod:`libcuflynx.emulators`, removed in 0.6.0.

Importing this name emits a single ``DeprecationWarning`` and then hands back the real
``libcuflynx.emulators`` package -- the same module object, not a copy -- so that
``isinstance`` checks and monkeypatching against classes reached through the old name
keep working. See ``libcuflynx/_deprecated_aliases.py`` for how, and why it takes a
meta path finder to make ``import emulators.<submodule>`` identical too.
