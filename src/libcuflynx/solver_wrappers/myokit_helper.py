    Myokit creates its user config directory at import time with a bare
    ``if not os.path.exists(DIR_USER): os.makedirs(DIR_USER)`` -- a check and a create with a
    gap in between. Under ``mpiexec`` every rank imports at once, so on a machine where
    ``~/.config/myokit`` does not yet exist the ranks all see "missing", all call ``makedirs``,
    and every one but the winner dies with ``FileExistsError``.

    It only ever happens on the *first* parallel run, because afterwards the directory is there
    -- which is why it presents as a CI job that passes when re-run, and why it is easy to
    dismiss as noise. It is not noise: it is equally a user's first ``./run_param_id.sh 4`` on a
    new machine or a fresh HPC home directory, where it reads as "Myokit is not installed".

    Retrying is the fix rather than pre-creating the directory ourselves, because the path is
    Myokit's to decide (it has already moved once, from ``~/.myokit``) and a copy of that rule
    here would stop matching without saying so. A failed import leaves nothing in
    ``sys.modules``, so the retry genuinely re-runs the module -- by which time the winning rank
    has created the directory and the import takes the "already exists" branch.

    Only ``FileExistsError`` is retried. Every other import failure is the caller's to see
    immediately, and is reported with its reason by ``solver_wrappers`` (#410).

    sensitivity variables are **excluded from the local error test**: the step size is chosen

    perturbation as ``sqrt(max(rtol, uround)) * pbar``, so tightening rtol shrinks that
    perturbation (more cancellation noise per evaluation) *and* takes more steps (more
    evaluations to accumulate it) -- the two effects compound and the sensitivities drift.
