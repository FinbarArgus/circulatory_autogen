"""A `SimulationHelper` that answers from a trained emulator instead of integrating (issue #333).

Everything downstream of a simulation -- the cost, Sobol sampling, MCMC, the Laplace Hessian --
reaches the model through the helper interface, so putting the emulator behind that interface
is what lets all of them use it without any of them knowing. The helper is constructed by the
same factory as every other backend (``get_simulation_helper(..., use_emulator=True)``), so an
emulator can be used wherever a solver is.

What it emulates is the *scalar feature* of each obs_data data_item -- the value after the
``operation`` reduction -- not the trace it was reduced from. That is why ``emulates_features``
is True: the two places that would otherwise apply the operation read it and skip that step,
because applying ``max_minus_min`` to an already-reduced scalar would quietly return zero.
Anything that genuinely needs a trace (plotting, saving all outputs, prediction items) raises
rather than inventing one.

Time is still tracked exactly as the real backends track it. The protocol executor accumulates
``tSim`` across sub-experiments whatever ran underneath, so the bookkeeping has to be right even
though nothing is integrated.
