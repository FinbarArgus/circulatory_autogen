"""Fitting an emulator of the forward model (issue #333).

The expensive analyses -- Sobol SA at ``num_samples*(2M+2)`` runs, MCMC at tens of thousands,
identifiability at a Hessian's worth -- all reach the model through one narrow interface:
theta in, scalar observable features out. This trains a surrogate of exactly that function, so
those analyses can evaluate it instead.

The training targets come from :func:`param_id.fd_backend.observable_features`, which is the
same function the cost is computed from. That is deliberate and load-bearing: a second
implementation of "reduce a run to its features" would let the emulator be accurate about
something the calibration is not fitting.

The N training runs are paid up front, so the win is real for Sobol, MCMC and identifiability,
and is *not* real for a single GA calibration, which may well be cheaper run directly.
