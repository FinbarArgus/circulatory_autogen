"""The trained-emulator artefact: the fitted model, its metadata, and every refusal rule.

An emulator does not fail loudly. Handed parameters it was never trained on, or fitted to a
design too small for the response it is approximating, it returns plausible numbers, and every
Sobol index, cost and posterior computed from them inherits the error silently. So the artefact
carries what is needed to *disprove* itself -- held-out R2 per output, the parameter box it was
trained in, and a fingerprint of the model, parameters and protocol it was trained against --
and CA refuses to use it when any of those disagree with the run at hand (issue #333).

The bundle also owns the input/output scaling. CA parameters span many orders of magnitude
(compliances near 1e-9 next to resistances near 1e8) and autoemulate works in float32 torch,
where that spread destroys a kernel fit. Parameters are mapped to the unit box and features are
standardised here, before anything reaches the emulator, and the transforms are stored in the
metadata -- an emulator reloaded without them would predict in the wrong units.
