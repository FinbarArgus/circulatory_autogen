"""Emulators CA builds itself, wrapping autoemulate rather than replacing it.

autoemulate's emulators are regressors, and a regressor is the wrong shape for an
observable that spends most of its range pinned at one value. A spike count is the
example that motivated this: below rheobase it is exactly zero, above it jumps to
one spike per window, and there is no value in between the model can produce. Fit a
smooth regressor to that and it splits the difference -- predicting a fraction of a
spike across the floor, and undershooting everywhere above it.

The response surface is a floor, a cliff and a staircase, which the cardiac
electrophysiology literature calls a bifurcation: the model changes behaviour as a
parameter crosses a threshold, and a stationary kernel has to pick one length scale
for both sides of it. The standard answer is two stages -- learn *where* the
boundary is with a classifier, and learn the magnitude with a regressor fitted only
on the far side, so the floor cannot drag it down.

``TwoPhaseEmulator`` does that and keeps autoemulate for both regression halves, so
every setting that works for a plain run works here. The variants are exposed as
``two_phase_<name>`` for each autoemulate emulator -- ``two_phase_MLP``,
``two_phase_RandomForest`` and so on -- and are **deliberately absent from the
``all`` set**: two stages cost more to fit than one and are only worth it when the
features really do have a floor, so they are opt-in by name.

    emulator_settings:
      models: two_phase_MLP

Nothing about spiking is hardcoded. A "floor" is whatever single value a feature
returns unusually often, found from the training data.

# ================================================================================
# multi-phase: one emulator, three kinds of observable
#
# A study's observables are not all the same shape, and fitting them as though they
# were is what the two-phase emulator was a first answer to. This is the second.
# Three kinds are recognised, each from the training data rather than from a name:
#
#   count   an integer-valued observable -- a spike count in a window. The forward
#           model is deterministic and returns one integer, so what is learned is a
#           *classifier* over the integers it returns, and what is predicted is the
#           expected count under that classifier. Never negative (so a Poisson cost
#           never meets its clip), and smooth in theta because the class
#           probabilities are, so an optimiser still has a gradient to follow.
#
#   jump    a continuous observable that lives on two separated branches -- the peak
#           voltage of a trace that either spikes or does not. A classifier picks the
#           branch and **a regressor of the base family is fitted on each side**, so
#           the quiet branch is predicted rather than pinned to a constant. That is
#           the difference from ``two_phase_``, which substitutes the floor value on
#           the inactive side and so cannot follow it at all.
#
#   smooth  everything else, straight from the base regressor.
#
# One base family per emulator: ``multi_phase_MLP`` uses an MLP for every regressor
# it fits, ``multi_phase_RadialBasisFunctions`` an RBF. Mixing families inside one
# emulator would make the comparison between them meaningless.
# ================================================================================

#: A column is a count when every finite value is a non-negative integer and it takes
#: at least this many distinct values -- one value is a constant, not a count.
COUNT_MIN_CLASSES = 2

#: ...and at most this many. A count with hundreds of levels is a continuous quantity for
#: every practical purpose, and a classifier over it would be all variance.
#:
#: Left at 24 deliberately. Raising it to 64 (so that counts with 26-53 levels became
#: _ExpectedCount models rather than falling through to the regressor) does remove the
#: negative predictions of #498 -- but it roughly doubles the error on exactly those
#: features (RMSE +107% on ox1, +81% on cpvt, measured on 12000-sample bundles) and makes
#: the whole emulator worse: std(dcost) 2.675 -> 3.097 on ox1 and 3.385 -> 4.343 on cpvt.
#: The warning above is correct; a 42-class classifier really is all variance. The negatives
#: are handled by clamping in MultiPhaseEmulator.predict instead, which costs nothing.
