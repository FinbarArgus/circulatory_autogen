"""Rewrite an obs_data.json into the vocabulary introduced by #466.

    cuflynx-migrate-obs-data resources/            # every obs_data file under a directory
    cuflynx-migrate-obs-data my_obs_data.json --dry-run

``variable`` and ``name_for_plotting`` each named two different things, and the split is not
purely mechanical, which is why this exists rather than a note in the changelog:

* ``variable`` becomes ``data_item_name``, and on a ``prediction_item`` it also seeds
  ``operands`` -- there was no ``operands`` key there at all, the model variable *was*
  ``variable``.
* ``name_for_plotting`` becomes ``trace_name_for_plotting``.
* ``data_item_name`` has to be unique across ``data_items`` and ``prediction_items``, because it
  is what an ``operation_kwargs`` reference to another item resolves against. Files that named
  one variable once per feature -- the mean and the max of a trace, or one variable measured
  across experiments -- now collide, so a colliding name is qualified by whatever actually
  distinguishes the items: the operation first, then the experiment and sub-experiment.

Edits are textual, so each file keeps its own hand formatting and the diff shows only the keys
and names that moved. An ``operation_kwargs`` value that referenced a renamed item is followed
through, so a difference-of-two-observables item keeps pointing at the right pair.
