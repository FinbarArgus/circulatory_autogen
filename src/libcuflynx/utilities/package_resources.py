"""Access to the data files shipped inside the ``libcuflynx`` package.

The CellML module library (``libcuflynx/generators/resources``) and the other non-Python
files that live inside the package are *package data*, not source, so they must be located
through :mod:`importlib.resources` rather than by walking up from ``__file__``. The
``__file__`` spelling only works when the package happens to be a plain directory sitting
next to the repo checkout; ``importlib.resources`` works for a normal wheel install, an
editable install and a zipimported distribution alike.

Two kinds of accessor are offered, because the consumers differ:

* :func:`package_data_file` (and its wrappers) returns a ``Traversable`` and is the right
  thing when a single file is read (``.read_text()`` / ``.open()``).
* :func:`package_data_dir` (and its wrappers) returns a **real filesystem directory path**.
  Several consumers need one: they ``os.listdir`` the module library, mix its entries into
  a single list with user-supplied directories, and hand the resulting strings to
  ``open()``, to ``shutil.copy2`` and to libCellML. Those cannot take a ``Traversable``.

:func:`package_data_dir` never stringifies a ``Traversable``: it goes through
:func:`importlib.resources.as_file`, whose context manager is held open for the life of the
process by a module-level :class:`~contextlib.ExitStack`. For a directory install (the
normal and the editable case) ``as_file`` yields the real directory and nothing is copied.
Only a zipimported distribution pays for an extraction, and only once.
