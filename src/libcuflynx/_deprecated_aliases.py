"""Machinery behind the deprecated flat top-level import names.

Before the rename every module in this project sat at the top level of ``src/`` and was
reached with a ``sys.path.insert(0, 'src')`` followed by ``from param_id.paramID import
CVS0DParamID``. 0.4.0 moved all of it under :mod:`libcuflynx`. The shim packages in
``src/<name>/`` keep the old spellings working for exactly one release; they are removed
in 0.6.0 (see :data:`REMOVAL_VERSION`). Deferred from 0.5.0: that release carries the
#466 obs_data break, and stacking the namespace removal on top would have made one
release ask users for two unrelated migrations.

Object identity is the whole difficulty
---------------------------------------
``param_id.paramID.CVS0DParamID`` has to *be* ``libcuflynx.param_id.paramID.CVS0DParamID``,
not a second class object that happens to have the same source. Otherwise user code that
did ``isinstance(x, CVS0DParamID)`` against the old name, or monkeypatched an attribute on
it, silently stops matching the object the package itself uses -- the worst kind of
deprecation, one that does not raise.

A shim written as ``from libcuflynx.param_id import *`` fails that: it creates a second
module object and copies references into it, so ``param_id.paramID`` is a different module
from ``libcuflynx.param_id.paramID`` even though the classes inside happen to be shared,
and anything imported lazily or added later is simply absent.

Nor is ``sys.modules['param_id'] = libcuflynx.param_id`` enough on its own. That fixes the
package object, but the *submodules* are then resolved through that package's ``__path__``
by the ordinary path finder, which loads ``paramID.py`` a second time under the name
``param_id.paramID`` -- a genuinely distinct module holding a genuinely distinct
``CVS0DParamID``.

So the shim does both:

1. :class:`_AliasFinder` goes on ``sys.meta_path``. ``sys.meta_path`` is consulted before
   the parent package's ``__path__``, so the finder gets first refusal on *submodules* of
   a root that was aliased and answers with a loader that hands back the module that is
   *already* imported under its ``libcuflynx.`` name rather than loading anything.
2. :func:`install_shim` rebinds ``sys.modules[<root>]`` to the real package, and is the
   one-line body of each ``src/<root>/__init__.py``. Those directories exist so that the
   old names are found at all (and so setuptools' ``packages.find`` ships them); the
   finder they install is what makes everything below them resolve correctly.

Scope: the finder claims as little as it can get away with
----------------------------------------------------------
``SHIM_ROOTS`` is eleven very ordinary words -- ``models``, ``scripts``, ``utilities``,
``checks``. A finder at ``sys.meta_path[0]`` that answered for any name whose root is in
that set would mean that importing *one* shim rebinds all eleven process-wide, so a
downstream project with its own ``utilities.py`` on ``sys.path`` would silently get ours
from the moment anything did ``import param_id``. Nothing announces that; it is the same
class of failure the identity work above exists to prevent.

So :meth:`_AliasFinder.find_spec` declines twice over. It declines the *root* name, because
the physical ``src/<root>/__init__.py`` shim is the correct resolver for it and the ordinary
path finder locates that -- respecting whatever else is earlier on ``sys.path``. And it
declines a submodule whose root was not actually aliased in this process, which is the only
case where first refusal is needed at all.

Exactly one :exc:`DeprecationWarning` is emitted per shim root per process -- not one per
attribute access and not one per submodule -- because :func:`_warn_once` records the roots
it has already warned about.
