Nodes: the points where vessel ports meet.

A vessel array connects modules in pairs (``A`` lists ``B`` in its out_vessels), but where several
vessels meet, the physics is a property of the point they share, not of each pair. Take
``aortic_arch_II`` flowing into a node that ``aortic_arch_III`` and ``common_carotid_L`` both leave
from, where ``aortic_arch_III``'s inlet compliance sets the pressure: ``aortic_arch_III``'s net
inflow is ``v(aortic_arch_II) - v(common_carotid_L)``, and ``common_carotid_L`` takes its inlet
pressure from ``aortic_arch_III``, a module it is not connected to in the array.

A **node** is the set of vessel-port ends joined by connections: an exit end of ``A`` and the
entrance ends of everything in ``A``'s out_vessels, closed under the same rule from each of those.
Its **owner** is the one end whose vessel_port has a list-form multi_port with a ``"sum"`` entry
(normally the compliant end of a vessel, ``["sum", "True"]`` on ``[flow, pressure]``). For every
other end, position by position in the port's variables:

* a ``"sum"`` entry of the owner gets that end's variable as a term, added when the end is on the
  other side of the node from the owner (it flows towards the owner) and subtracted when it is on
  the same side (it flows away);
* a ``"True"`` entry of the owner is mapped to that end's variable (one source, many sinks).

A node is only built from module ends that have exactly one vessel_port on that side. Modules with
several vessel_ports on one side (the heart, the legacy fixed-arity junctions) keep the pairwise
port matching, as does every node with no owner and every node with a "Multiply" port.
