"""Myokit CVODES forward-sensitivity (FSA) gradient for the param-id classes.

This is the analytic-gradient path for stiff / long-warmup ``cellml`` models, which
neither CasADi nor AADC covers. Every public function takes the param-id object as its first
argument (``pid``); the ``_fsa_*`` bookkeeping stays as instance attributes on it, so
anything inspecting ``pid._fsa_ineligible_names`` keeps working.

Nothing here imports ``param_id.paramID`` -- the dependency runs one way only and this module
imports standalone, matching ``param_id.plot_outputs`` and ``param_id.casadi_backend``.

Generic methods this module calls back into on ``pid``:
  - ``get_cost_obs_and_pred_from_params(param_vals, reset=True, only_one_exp=k)``
  - ``get_cost_from_operands(operands, exp_idx=..., sub_idx=...)``
  - ``get_cost_from_params(param_vals)``  (the FD fallback for ineligible parameters)
  - ``_total_weighted_obs_denominator()``  (generic; deliberately left in paramID.py next to
    the cost-assembly layer that computes the same divisor inline in two other places)

There is no optional import to guard: FSA capability is probed at runtime through
``hasattr(pid.sim_helper, 'enable_fsa')``.

    With ``return_cost=True`` this returns ``(cost, grad)`` instead of just ``grad``. The

    is reconstructed from them with ``get_cost_from_operands`` (cheap arithmetic, no extra
    solve) -- it is identical to ``get_cost_from_params(p)``. This lets L-BFGS-B get both
    the value and the gradient from one CVODES solve per point instead of two.

    FSA gives S = d(operand_trace)/dp for every eligible parameter. Rather than
    differentiate each observable operation and cost term by hand, we perturb the
    operand traces along S (operand + h*S ≈ operand(p+h)) and re-evaluate the *existing*
    cost path get_cost_from_operands; the finite difference over h is dJ/dp exactly (S is
    the true trace derivative), reusing every operation / weight / std / cost function
    with no duplication. An entry containing any FSA-ineligible member gets a central
    finite difference over the full cost instead.

    Grouped and modifier entries are exact: theta's perturbation runs along the combined
    sensitivity sum_i w_i * S_i of all members (w_i = 1 shared-value, w_i = baseline_i
    scale modifier), matching how set_param_vals moves every member since #376.

    Multi-sub-experiment protocols are supported: the Myokit helper carries dy/dp across
    sub-experiment boundaries (myokit_helper.update_times), so each sub's operand
    sensitivities already include the parameter's effect through earlier subs' end states
    (the cross-sub chain-rule term). Summing the per-sub directional derivatives is then
