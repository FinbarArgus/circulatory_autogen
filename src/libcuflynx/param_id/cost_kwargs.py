"""The ``cost_kwargs`` contract for user-defined cost functions (issue #84).

Cost funcs were called with a fixed positional signature ``(output, ground_truth, std, weight)``
at every call site, which forced two things on every cost func ever written:

* it had to accept ``std`` and ``weight`` even when the cost does not use them -- and a cost that
  genuinely has no notion of a standard deviation (an absolute bound, a barrier, a
  distribution-fit) had to take the argument and drop it;
* it could take nothing else, so a user cost with a tolerance, an exponent or a reference scale
  had no way to receive it short of a module-level global.

This module is the single place that decides what a given cost func is actually called with. It
deliberately mirrors the ``operation_kwargs`` contract in ``param_id.operation_funcs`` (issue
#304) -- same shape, same validation stance, same reserved-name handling -- so the two
user-extension points behave the same way rather than each having their own rules.

Framework-supplied arguments (``std``, ``weight``) are passed only when the func's signature has
somewhere to put them. User arguments come from a data_item's ``cost_kwargs`` mapping.
