"""AADC (Matlogica) tape-based cost and gradient for the param-id classes.

The AADC backend records the forward integration on a tape and replays it, so the cost has
to be re-implemented on that tape rather than reusing the generic cost-assembly path -- both
the cost and its gradient then come out of one tape evaluation and cannot drift apart. That
is why this module, unlike casadi_backend and fsa_backend, calls no generic method of the
param-id object at all: it needs only ``pid.sim_helper`` and the raw obs/protocol/param
dicts.

``cost_and_grad(pid, param_vals)`` takes the param-id object as its first argument. Nothing
here imports ``param_id.paramID``; the module imports standalone.

AADC is optional third-party proprietary software. It is imported lazily inside
``cost_on_tape`` (i.e. only once a tape is actually being recorded), exactly as before the
extraction -- hoisting it to module scope would change when ImportError surfaces on a
machine without AADC.
