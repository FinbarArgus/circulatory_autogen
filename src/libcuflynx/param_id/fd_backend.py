"""Finite-difference observable sensitivities -- the backend-agnostic arm of
``ParamID.get_observable_sensitivities`` (issue #338).

The analytic arms are better and stay the default: CasADi differentiates the
observable vector, and Myokit CVODES gives the exact operand sensitivity. But
they only exist for two backends. AADC has none, and neither does the plain
``python`` (scipy) backend, so local sensitivity analysis was simply unavailable
there and the user was told to run a global Sobol SA instead -- a different
analysis, costing ``num_samples*(2M+2)`` simulations rather than ``2M``.

This computes the same quantity by re-simulating: central differences on the
parameter vector, with the features re-evaluated through the ordinary observable
path. It works wherever a forward run does.

**Never a silent fallback.** ``get_observable_sensitivities`` still raises when
no analytic backend is available and none was asked for, because a result
quietly computed a different way is not the same result: FD costs ``2M``
simulations, and its accuracy depends on a step size the analytic arms do not
have. The caller opts in by name (``method='FD'``), so what produced a number is
always something they chose.
