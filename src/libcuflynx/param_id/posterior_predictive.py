"""Draw from a posterior, run the model at each draw, and check the result covers the data.

A chain says what the parameters could be. It does not say whether the model, at
those parameters, reproduces what was measured -- and a calibration that fits
badly can still produce a tidy-looking posterior. The check is to push samples
back through the forward model and ask how often the data lands inside the
predictions.

Two coverage numbers, because they answer different questions and are easy to
confuse:

``predictive_coverage``
    How often the measured value falls inside the model's own central interval at
    each level. Nominal: an 80% interval should contain about 80% of the
    observations. Well below means the posterior is too narrow or biased; well
    above means it is too wide to say much.

``sample_interval_coverage``
    What fraction of the posterior draws land inside the measurement's own
    interval, ``value +/- z*std``, averaged over observables. Each observable's
    error bar is treated as a fixed window and the posterior mass inside it is
    counted, so an observable whose draws straddle the window scores partly
    rather than being called a hit or a miss on its median alone. A model
    centred on the measurement with the measurement's own spread scores the
    nominal level. ``per_observable`` carries the individual fractions.

Run it against the **solver**, not an emulator, unless you only want a smoke test:
an emulator scoring its own predictions against the data cannot tell you that the
emulator is wrong, and it is the emulator's error you most want this to catch.
``posterior_predictive`` therefore builds its engine with ``use_emulator`` forced
off by default.
