#   adaptive_rk45        no return; killed at 180 s for a 0.01 s horizon

#   semi_implicit_signed OK, +2%  (at its defaults: max_step 0.001, jac_lag 10)

# its forward integrator was being written. That measurement was taken from the model's own cold
# initial conditions with pre_time=0, where the whole window is a startup transient: every
# variant of the scheme -- and CVODE itself -- peaks near 3.1e5 there, so it showed a difference
# between two setups rather than between two integrators. Re-measured after a 5 s spin-up, the
# scheme's four distinguishing features (signed diagonal, lagged Jacobian, sub-stepping, no valve
# clamp) land it within 2% of CVODE_myokit, which is better than semi_implicit's +16% at dt=0.01.
# Its stability depends on max_step and jac_lag together, so both are documented above.
#
# implicit_euler_ift is deliberately excluded despite completing. It is still in

# wrong by a factor of six while returning a smooth trace is worse than raising. Why it is wrong
# is not yet established (issue #346).

    Each descriptor:
      * ``value``  -- 'FD' | 'AD' | 'FSA' (the UI selector value)
      * ``label``  -- human-readable name
      * ``do_ad``  -- the top-level ``do_ad`` user-input flag CA needs for this source. There is
                      no per-method "gradient" option in CA: AD vs finite differences is chosen by
                      ``do_ad``, and which analytic backend runs follows from model_type/solver.
                      Finite differences is ``do_ad`` False; every analytic source is ``do_ad`` True.
      * ``requires_all_differentiable`` -- True only for CasADi AD, which needs every operation in
                      the specific model to be differentiable. That is a per-model runtime property
                      (not knowable from model_type/solver alone), so a caller that has loaded the
                      model should gate the source on it -- e.g. via ``is_circulatory_differentiable``
                      over the cost/operation funcs. All other sources are False.
      * ``description``

    The analytic source, if any, follows exactly ``OpencorParamID.get_gradient`` dispatch (and
    ``AD_GRADIENT_MODEL_TYPES`` / ``fsa_gradient_available`` in the optimisers):
      * ``casadi_python``               -> symbolic CasADi AD
      * ``aadc_python``                 -> AADC tape AD (needs a Matlogica licence at runtime)
      * ``cellml_only`` + ``CVODE_myokit`` -> Myokit CVODES forward sensitivity (FSA)
      * otherwise                       -> finite differences only
    Finite differences is always available. This is the single source of truth these rules were
    previously duplicated from in downstream tools (e.g. CUFLynx); keep it in step with
    get_gradient.

    ``use_emulator`` (issue #333) collapses the menu to finite differences alone: the analytic
    arms differentiate the real model, and an emulator run is not evaluating it.

    When ``method`` (the integrator plugin) is given, the analytic source is additionally gated on
    per-integrator suitability (``SOLVER_SCHEMA['ad_suitable_methods']`` /
    ``['fsa_suitable_methods']``): the CasADi AD descriptor is omitted for a casadi_integrator
    method that uses adjoint sensitivity (cvodes/idas, which can't produce a usable AD gradient),
    and FSA is omitted for a non-FSA method. ``method=None`` leaves the source ungated. Issue #298.
