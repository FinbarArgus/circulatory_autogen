# Developer documentation for tutorial

## Before Submitting a Pull Request!!

For developers adapting the tutorial in local machine,
check that the tutorial formatting is correct by doing the following

1. Install `Material for MkDocs` using:

    ```
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

2. Navigate to the `/tutorial` directory and start the live preview server using:

    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    The site will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/. 
    
    The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving, so you can preview your changes as you write.


Note: When the changes to the `tutorial` directory are merged into the master branch (after a pull request), it will get automatically deployed to the website.
