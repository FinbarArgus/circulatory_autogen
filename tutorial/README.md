# Developer documentation for tutorial

## Running tutorial in local machine

1. Install `Material for MkDocs` using:

    ```
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

2. Navigate to the `/tutorial` directory and start the live preview server using:

    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    The site will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/. 
    
    The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving, so you can preview your changes as you write.

Note: When you push the changes to the `tutorial` directory in the master branch, it will get automatically deployed to the website.
