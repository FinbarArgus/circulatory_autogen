# Running on HPC

## ABI HPC

If running on the ABI HPC, you can use a pre-installed (with all neccesary libraries) OpenCOR pythonshell. To do this, you need to clone the circulatory\_autogen repo into a directory of your choice, then change the opencor\_pythonshell\_path in opencor\_pythonshell\_path.sh to...

`opencor_pythonshell_path=/hpc/farg967/OpenCOR-0-8-1-Linux/pythonshell`

Then you should be able to run as normal from the user\_run\_files dir
