# Running on HPC

## ABI HPC Standard

If running on the ABI HPC, you can use a pre-installed (with all neccesary libraries) OpenCOR pythonshell. To do this, you need to clone the circulatory\_autogen repo into a directory of your choice, then change the opencor\_pythonshell\_path in opencor\_pythonshell\_path.sh to...

`opencor_pythonshell_path=/hpc/farg967/OpenCOR-0-8-1-Linux/pythonshell`

Following that to run in parallel you need to load mpich. Do the following from the {project_dir}/user_run_files dir:

`. load_mpi.sh`

Then you should be able to run as normal from the user\_run\_files dir

## ABI HPC Extra

If you need to install specific python libraries that aren't installed in the above OpenCOR python version, then you 
will need to install a separate OpenCOR and install the libraries. See getting-started for how to install python libraries, 
the process should be the same on the HPC.
