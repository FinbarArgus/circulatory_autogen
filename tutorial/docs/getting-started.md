# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.9 or newer — `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.9"`, and the package really does need it (`importlib.resources.files`). Use the same interpreter for the whole project.
- **Git**, to clone the repository.
- **pip** (usually bundled with Python).
- **MPI** (optional): needed only if you run parameter identification or sensitivity analysis with multiple processes. See [MPI and system libraries](#mpi-and-system-libraries) below.
- **Compiler / SUNDIALS** (optional on Linux): Myokit’s CVODE backend may need `build-essential` and `libsundials-dev` (or your OS equivalent) so extensions can compile when first used.

## Install the package

The repository is called **`circulatory_autogen`**; the package it installs is called
**`libcuflynx`**. Both names refer to the same project — papers and the repository use the
first, PyPI and every `import` uses the second.

```
pip install libcuflynx
```

That is all that is needed to import the library, run the console commands
(`cuflynx-generate`, `cuflynx-param-id`, …) and work from any directory — no checkout, and no
import path to set up. Optional capabilities are extras, because they are large;
see the size table in the [README](https://github.com/physiomelinks/circulatory_autogen#installing-and-what-each-extra-costs):

```
pip install "libcuflynx[mpi]"        # multi-rank runs under mpiexec (needs a system MPI)
pip install "libcuflynx[casadi]"     # model_type: casadi_python, symbolic AD gradients
pip install "libcuflynx[uq]"         # the pyMC sampler
pip install "libcuflynx[emulation]"  # surrogate models (pulls in torch; big)
```

!!! note "The flat imports are deprecated"
    `from param_id.paramID import CVS0DParamID` still works in 0.4.0 with a
    `DeprecationWarning`, and is **removed in 0.6.0**. Use
    `from libcuflynx.param_id.paramID import CVS0DParamID`.

### Where an installed libcuflynx reads and writes: `CUFLYNX_USER_DIR`

Every stage needs a **user directory** — the one holding `user_run_files/user_inputs.yaml`
and, unless the config overrides them, `resources/`, `module_config_user/`, `funcs_user/`,
`generated_models/` and `param_id_output/`. It is chosen in this order:

1. **`$CUFLYNX_USER_DIR`**, if set — an absolute path (`~` is expanded).
2. the **circulatory_autogen checkout** this `libcuflynx` is being run from, if it is one
   (including `pip install -e .`), so the developer workflow needs no configuration;
3. otherwise the **current working directory**.

After a plain `pip install libcuflynx` there is no checkout, so rule 2 never fires: either
run from your working directory, or point the variable at it, which is the only way to run
from anywhere else without editing a config.

```
export CUFLYNX_USER_DIR=/path/to/my_study     # holds user_run_files/, resources/, …
cuflynx-generate False
```

Nothing is ever written inside the installed package — that was issue #431. Individual
directories can still be overridden per-run with `resources_dir`, `generated_models_dir`,
`param_id_output_dir` and `external_modules_dir` in `user_inputs.yaml`; `CUFLYNX_USER_DIR`
is what the defaults hang off when the config names none.

The rest of this page sets up a **checkout**, which is what the tutorial's shell-script
workflow (`user_run_files/*.sh`, `resources/`, `module_config_user/`) and any development work
need. If you only want to drive the library from Python, the `pip install` above is enough —
skip to [Model Generation and Simulation](model-generation-simulation.md).

## Clone the repository

Clone the Circulatory Autogen project from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FinbarArgus/circulatory_autogen).

!!! note
    If you have not used Git before: install Git, open a terminal, go to the folder where you want the code, then run:

    - `git clone https://github.com/FinbarArgus/circulatory_autogen`

    To contribute via a fork:

    - `git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/circulatory_autogen`

    - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/physiomelinks/circulatory_autogen`

## Directory layout

**`[project_dir]`** is the folder where the repository was cloned, for example:

`[project_dir]: ~/Documents/git_projects/circulatory_autogen`

The rest of this page assumes commands are run from a terminal and that `[project_dir]` is your current directory when installing.

## Install Python libraries from `pyproject.toml`

Use the **same Python** you will use to run scripts and tests (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`).

**1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```
    cd [project_dir]
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== "Windows (cmd)"
    ```
    cd [project_dir]
    py -3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

=== "Windows (PowerShell)"
    ```
    cd [project_dir]
    py -3 -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

If you prefer not to use a venv, skip the steps above and use `python -m pip` / `python3 -m pip` for the installs below.

**2. Upgrade pip (recommended)**

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**3. Install the project and dependencies**

Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`. Installing the package in editable mode pulls them in automatically.

- **Runtime only** (autogeneration, parameter ID, solvers such as Myokit, etc.):

    ```
    cd [project_dir]
    python -m pip install -e .
    ```

    When you choose `solver: CVODE` for CellML models, the project defaults that to the `CVODE_myokit` backend. Use `CVODE_opencor` explicitly only when you want the OpenCOR backend.

- **With development tools** (pytest, formatters, linters):

    ```
    cd [project_dir]
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

The authoritative lists are `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`. Highlights:

- Autogeneration: `pandas`, `pyyaml`, `rdflib`, `libcellml`, `pint`, etc.

    !!! warning "libCellML is pinned below 0.7.0"
        The requirement is `libcellml>=0.6.3,<0.7.0`. libCellML 0.7.0 renamed part of the API
        (`Analyser.model()` became `Analyser.analyserModel()`, and `Generator.implementationCode()`
        now takes the model and profile as arguments) and also changed generated-Python output and
        unit flattening. The renames are handled by shims in
        `src/libcuflynx/utilities/libcellml_helper_funcs.py`, but the code-generation and unit changes are a
        real migration that has not been done yet, so the pin stays until it is.

        **If you already have libCellML 0.7.0 installed**, `pip install -e ".[dev]"` will silently
        *downgrade* it to the newest 0.6.x. That is intended — but if libCellML came from conda or
        a system package rather than pip, the resolver may instead fail with a version conflict
        that does not obviously point here. Installing into a fresh virtual environment avoids
        both. Lifting the pin is tracked in issue #271.
- Parameter identification: `mpi4py`, `nevergrad` (CMA-ES), `emcee`, `numdifftools`, and related scientific stack.
- Sensitivity analysis: `SALib`, `seaborn`.
- **Development**: the `dev` extra (e.g. `pytest`, `pytest-mpi`).

**4. Point the shell helpers at your venv**

The shell scripts under `user_run_files/` (`run_param_id.sh`, `run_autogeneration.sh`, `run_pytest.sh`, …) all invoke whatever interpreter `user_run_files/python_path.sh` names. Edit that file once so `python_path` is **your venv’s Python**, using an absolute path:

=== "Linux / macOS"
    ```
    python_path=[project_dir]/.venv/bin/python
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```
    python_path=C:\[project_dir]\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
    ```

!!! warning "Do not point `python_path` at OpenCOR’s `pythonshell`"
    That is the deprecated setup — see [Deprecated: OpenCOR-based setup](#deprecated-opencor-based-setup). The scripts contain nothing OpenCOR-specific; they only need an interpreter with the project installed. (`python_path.sh` does **not** read `opencor_pythonshell_path.sh` — that file is unused legacy and is scheduled for removal along with `python_path.sh` itself.)

**5. Run scripts**

With the project installed, the console commands are on your `PATH` and can be run from any
directory: `cuflynx-generate`, `cuflynx-param-id`, `cuflynx-sensitivity`,
`cuflynx-identifiability`, `cuflynx-train-emulator`, `cuflynx-plot` (and
`cuflynx-sequential-param-id`, which is declared but not yet implemented). Every one of them
reads `user_run_files/user_inputs.yaml` and takes `--help`. `cuflynx-calibration-workflow`
instead takes a `calibration_workflow.json` (see
[Calibration workflows](parameter-identification.md#calibration-workflows)).

The other scripts that ship in the package are run as modules, for example:

```
python -m libcuflynx.scripts.<script_name>
```

or use the shell helper for the same stage, e.g. `cd user_run_files && ./run_autogeneration.sh`
(each helper invokes the matching console command, so the editable install above is a
prerequisite for them).

For a notebook-oriented walkthrough, see `tutorial/interactive/generation_and_calibration.ipynb`.

**6. Run the tests (optional, but do this after any change)**

```
cd [project_dir]
./run_pytest.sh
```

`run_pytest.sh` runs pytest under `mpiexec` using the `python_path` you set above — no OpenCOR involved.

- `./run_pytest.sh -n 4` — `-n N` is the **MPI rank count**, *not* pytest-xdist (xdist is force-disabled, because its workers conflict with MPI ranks).
- `./run_pytest.sh -m "not slow"` — skip the expensive tests. `-k <expr>` and any other arguments pass straight through to pytest.
- `./run_pytest.sh -m "not need_opencor"` — **use this if you have not installed OpenCOR.** A handful of tests exercise the optional `CVODE_opencor` backend; they are marked `need_opencor` but are *not* skipped automatically, so they fail rather than skip when OpenCOR is absent. That is expected, not a broken install.
- Equivalent without the script (handy if `python_path.sh` is set for someone else’s machine):

    ```
    mpiexec -n 1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest -p no:xdist -m "not need_opencor"
    ```

## Optional third-party backends (not part of Circulatory Autogen)

Circulatory Autogen itself is **fully open source** (Apache License 2.0) and everything
described in this documentation works without installing anything below.

This section describes **optional, third-party software that is *not* part of Circulatory
Autogen**. It is not bundled with it, not installed by `pip install -e .`, not required by
any feature, and not distributed under Circulatory Autogen's license. It is developed and
licensed by other parties, on their terms. Circulatory Autogen merely provides an optional
adapter so that users who *already* have a licence for such a product can plug it in. If
you install one, you are entering a licensing relationship with that third party, not with
this project.

### AADC (Matlogica) — proprietary, optional, not included

!!! danger "AADC is third-party proprietary software and is NOT part of Circulatory Autogen"
    - **Not included, not required.** AADC is **not** shipped with Circulatory Autogen and
      **no** feature of Circulatory Autogen depends on it. The project is fully functional,
      and fully open source, without it. Nothing installs it for you.
    - **Not open source.** [AADC](https://matlogica.com/) is a commercial product of
      **Matlogica**, distributed under **Matlogica's own proprietary licence** — *not* under
      Circulatory Autogen's Apache-2.0 licence, and not under any open-source licence. Its
      terms restrict it to **academic / non-commercial use**.
    - **You must obtain your own licence.** The Circulatory Autogen maintainers do not
      supply, sublicense, or broker AADC licences, and cannot support licensing issues.
      **Read and accept Matlogica's licence terms yourself, directly with Matlogica,**
      before installing or using it.
    - **Its gradients are licence-gated at runtime.** Forward simulation may run with a bare
      `pip install aadc`, but anything that records a tape — the automatic-differentiation
      gradients, and the on-tape damping in `semi_implicit` — raises
      `RuntimeError: AADC License check failed` without a valid licence.
    - **Use CasADi if you want a fully open-source pipeline.** CasADi (LGPL) is the
      **default and supported** AD backend and requires no proprietary licence — see
      `model_type: casadi_python` in
      [Parameter Identification](parameter-identification.md). AADC is **only** an optional
      alternative for licensed academic users; you never need it.

If, and only if, you hold a Matlogica licence and accept their terms, the optional adapter
is enabled by installing the package:

```
python -m pip install aadc
```

(Into the same venv you installed the project into — the one `python_path` points at.)

and then selecting it in your `user_inputs.yaml`:

```yaml
model_type: aadc_python
solver: aadc_semi_implicit
solver_info:
  method: adaptive_rk45   # non-stiff forward solve; see the gradient caveat below
```

Available `solver_info.method` values for the AADC adapter are `adaptive_rk45` (**adaptive**,
so accurate for a *forward* solve but **untapeable** — its step sequence depends on the
parameters, so it cannot produce an AD gradient), and the **fixed-step** `implicit_euler_ift`,
`semi_implicit`, and `rk4` (the only methods that can be recorded on a tape for an AD
gradient).

!!! note "`method: bdf` was removed from the AADC adapter"
    AADC previously offered a `bdf` method. It ran the solve inside `scipy.solve_ivp` with AADC
    supplying only the RHS and its Jacobian, so the trajectory never reached the tape — and the
    AD tape had no `bdf` branch, so `do_ad: true` silently recorded `rk4` instead, making the
    cost and the gradient different functions. Its RHS kernel was also taped once at `t=0` with
    the integrator discarding `t`, so a time-dependent model would have been integrated with
    its `t=0` right-hand side throughout. Setting `method: bdf` on an `aadc_python` model now
    raises. Use `semi_implicit` for stiff models — subject to the accuracy warning below — or
    `model_type: casadi_python` with `method: bdf` for a differentiable symbolic BDF.

!!! warning "AADC gradients do not work on stiff models"
    Only the fixed-step methods can be taped, and fixed-step schemes are inaccurate or unstable
    on **stiff** models: on the 3compartment cardiovascular model `semi_implicit` deviates from
    the CVODE reference by ~35% and `implicit_euler_ift` by orders of magnitude. Reducing `dt`
    does not help — `semi_implicit` *diverges* under step refinement (~35% at `dt=1e-3` rising
    to ~280% at `dt=1e-4`), because its damping factor `1/(1+dt*lam)` tends to 1 as `dt` shrinks
    and the scheme degenerates into explicit forward Euler on a very stiff system. The AADC
    backend probes the first second of dynamics and warns loudly when it detects a stiff model.
    **For gradient-based calibration of a stiff model, use CasADi `bdf` or Myokit CVODES forward
    sensitivity instead** — see [Parameter Identification](parameter-identification.md). AADC's
    tape gradient is appropriate only for non-stiff, state-observable, single-experiment
    problems.

## MPI and system libraries

!!! warning
    **mpi4py** needs an MPI implementation on the machine. On Linux you may need:

    ```
    sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
    ```

    On macOS, for example: `brew install openmpi`. On Windows, install [MS MPI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467) and the SDK, and ensure the MPI `bin` paths are on your `PATH` (see Microsoft’s documentation).

    **Myokit (CVODE)** on Linux often needs a compiler and SUNDIALS headers, for example:

    ```
    sudo apt install build-essential libsundials-dev
    ```

## Expected outcome

You should now have:

- A clone of the repository at `[project_dir]`.
- A Python environment (venv or global) with dependencies installed from `pyproject.toml` via `pip install -e .` or `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- The ability to run `python` and import the project after `cd [project_dir]` with your chosen interpreter.

---

## Deprecated: OpenCOR-based setup

This section documents the **older workflow** that used **OpenCOR’s bundled Python** and `python_path.sh`. It is **not required** for the default Myokit-based path described above. Keep it only if you maintain legacy scripts or environments that still call OpenCOR’s interpreter.

!!! warning "OpenCOR’s `pythonshell` is deprecated — it will be replaced by `pip install libopencor`"
    Do not build new workflows on OpenCOR’s bundled interpreter. Once
    [libOpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/libopencor/) is available on PyPI, the OpenCOR
    functionality will be obtained with a plain `pip install libopencor` into a
    normal Python environment, and `pythonshell` / `python_path.sh` /
    `opencor_pythonshell_path.sh` will be removed.

    Prefer the standard `pip install -e .` setup above. Relying on the bundled
    interpreter pins you to whatever OpenCOR ships, which causes real problems —
    e.g. OpenCOR bundles a **dual-ABI `mpi4py`** (both an `MPI.mpich.*.so` and an
    `MPI.openmpi.*.so`), and the variant chosen at import time may not match the
    system `mpiexec`, aborting MPI runs with
    `unsupported PMI version PMIx`. Pin it with `MPI4PY_MPIABI=openmpi` (or
    `mpich`) to match your installed launcher. A pip-installed `mpi4py` builds
    against the one system MPI and has no such ambiguity.

### Install OpenCOR (legacy)

Download OpenCOR (e.g. version 0.8.1) from the [OpenCOR downloads page](https://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html). A zip/tarball install in a directory you control (e.g. `~/Desktop`) is typical.

!!! note
    New to OpenCOR? See the [OpenCOR Tutorial (PDF)](https://tutorial-on-cellml-opencor-and-pmr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/d271cfcef7e288704c61320e64d77e2d/OpenCOR-Tutorial-v17.pdf).

### Legacy directory names

- **`[OpenCOR_dir]`**: folder where OpenCOR is installed, e.g. `~/Desktop/OpenCOR-0-8-1-Linux/`.

!!! info
    On some HPC systems an OpenCOR tree may already exist (example path used historically: `/hpc/farg967/OpenCOR-0-8-1-Linux/`). Use your site’s path if applicable. See also [running on hpc](running-on-hpc.md).

### Installing packages with OpenCOR’s pip (legacy)

From `[OpenCOR_dir]`, use OpenCOR’s pip interface instead of system Python:

!!! Note
    === "Linux"
        ```
        ./pip install <packagename>
        ```
    === "Mac"
        ```
        ./pythonshell -m pip install <packagename>
        ```
    === "Windows"
        ```
        ./pythonshell.bat -m pip install <packagename>
        ```

To install this project from `pyproject.toml` **into OpenCOR’s Python** (editable):

```
cd [project_dir]
[OpenCOR_dir]/pip install -e .
```

(Use `./pythonshell -m pip` / `./pythonshell.bat -m pip` on Mac/Windows as above.) For development tools: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

### `python_path.sh` pointed at a pythonshell (legacy)

The shell scripts under `user_run_files/` read `python_path` from `[project_dir]/user_run_files/python_path.sh`. The **legacy** setup set it to an OpenCOR pythonshell:

!!! Note
    === "Linux and Mac"
        ```
        python_path=<OpenCOR_dir>/pythonshell
        ```
    === "Windows"
        ```
        python_path=C:\<OpenCOR_dir>\pythonshell.bat
        ```
        Use Windows path conventions (`C:\`, backslashes).

**Do not do this for new setups** — point `python_path` at your venv instead, as in [step 4 above](#install-python-libraries-from-pyprojecttoml). The scripts still read this file either way; only the interpreter it names has changed. `python_path.sh` itself will be removed once libOpenCOR is on PyPI.

### OpenCOR versions before 0.8 and SSL (legacy)

!!! warning
    In **OpenCOR versions before 0.8** you may need:

    ```
    cd [OpenCOR_dir]/python/bin
    ./python -m pip install <packagename>
    ```

!!! warning
    If you see **SSL errors** with OpenCOR before version 0.8 on Linux:

    ```
    cd [OpenCOR_dir]/python/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[OpenCOR_dir]/lib
    ```

    Then retry pip so `libcrypto` can be found.
