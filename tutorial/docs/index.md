# Welcome to Circulatory Autogen

Circulatory Autogen aims to automate the process of combining CellML modules into a system model, then doing parameter identification to calibrate to clinical data. 

Common use cases include generating coupled neuron models, generating neuron to cardiomyocyte models, generating patient specific 0D blood flow networks and more.
